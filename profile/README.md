## 🎯 What Is a Triggerbot in BF5?

A **Triggerbot** is a low-key cheat that monitors your crosshair in real time. The second an enemy’s hitbox intersects with your aim, it **automatically fires** your weapon—**no input needed**. You still aim manually, but the shot lands *instantly* when it counts.

Perfect for **snipers**, **precision DMR users**, or anyone who wants to look totally legit while still fragging out.
